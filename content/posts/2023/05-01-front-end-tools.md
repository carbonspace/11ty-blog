This is a collection of front-end development tools and resources for creating interactive user interfaces. This includes everything that happens on a screen and is visible to the end user.

**These are tools that I've found useful in my daily web development process** I've divided these up into 2 main sections UI and UX, depending on whether they apply to User Interface Development or User Experience Design.

This is by no means a comprehensive list. These are just a few tools I find useful or want to check out further.

### Design Trends

[Neumorphism](https://neumorphism.io/#e0e0e0)  

Commonly identified by a soft and light look (for which it is sometimes referred to as soft UI) with elements that appear to protrude from or dent into the background rather than float on top of it. It is sometimes considered a medium between skeuomorphism and flat design.

[Skeuomorphism](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/skeuomorphism)  

In terms of UI and web design, skeuomorphism is the approach which is meant to imitate physical world objects. Skeuomorphism is a term most often used in graphical user interface design to describe interface objects that mimic their real-world counterparts in how they appear and/or how the user can interact with them. A well-known example is the recycle bin icon used for discarding files. Skeuomorphism makes interface objects familiar to users by using concepts they recognize.

Skeuomorphism is related to what ecological psychologist James Gibson termed ‚Äúaffordances.‚Äù Affordances refer to action possibilities of objects or other features of the environment. The most commonly cited examples of affordances include door handles and push buttons; their physical designs inform users that they can be rotated or pushed. Skeuomorphism represents affordances in digital user interfaces. It fits with our natural interpretation of objects‚Äîbut in a digital world.


#### Flat Design

A minimalist design language or design style of interface design emphasizing minimalist use of simple elements, typography, and flat colors

#### Material Design

Material Design tries to introduce some skeuomorphism back to a totally flat design, nevertheless, it does so in the most simplified fashion possible. I other words, material design is an improved version of flat design which stresses skeuomorphic details like animations, shades, and layers. This keeps a product simple yet allows navigation to feel more intuitive.
