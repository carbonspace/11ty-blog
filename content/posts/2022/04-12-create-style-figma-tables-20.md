Creating a table in Figma may seem like a straightforward task, but poses some common challenges that many designers face. The lack of a standardized approach has led designers to create tables manually, cell by cell, often with inconsistent formatting for different cell types. This results in inefficient workflows and a lot of wasted resources, not to mention the negative impact that design inconsistencies can have on user experiences.

This is a step-by-step walk through on how to create a table in Figma, as well as a few techniques to style and customize it to enhance the user experience.
